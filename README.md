# Virtual Keys Generator for Windows (VKGW)
## Introduction
With C++, "Windows.h" and "winuser.h" headers you can simulate key strokes. Sometimes it can be tedious to write down all those lines, so I made this simple code generator that will convert all your messages into code.

## Support
VKGW only supports (for now) the following:
* User message **must** be lower case.
* Numbers are not supported.
* Spaces are supported.
* Custom path for code file generated by the program is still in **development**.
* Convert more messages after converting the first one is still in **development**.

## Files and dependencies
VKGW is made thanks to the combination of three files. **All of them are required for the program to work**.
* VKCodeGenerator.cpp: Core.
* incluSing.cpp: File that contains all requires and using.
* VKReferences.txt: Contains the references to the virtual keys. Source: [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).

## Updates for the future
I'll keep updating this program as time passes (I don't have much time but I'll spend some of my free time updating it):
* Numbers and special characters.
* Upper case characters.
* Convert more than one message without need of restarting the program.
* Key combos (shortcuts).

###### Version 1.0.0. Changelog will be created after the very first update.
